Percent Spliced-In (PSI) values are commonly used to report alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) changes. However, previous PSI-detection methods are limited to specific types of AS events. PSI-Sigma is using a new splicing index (PSIÎ£) that is more flexible, can incoporate novel junctions, and can compute PSI values of individual exons in complex splicing events.
